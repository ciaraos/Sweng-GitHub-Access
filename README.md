# Sweng-GitHub-Access Assignments 5 and 6

## Assigment Goals:
* Using the GitHub API to retrieve and display data.
* Using the GitHub API to build visualization of data available 
* Use d3js library for visualization 

## Solution:
I decided the best and most interesting way to create a visualization of data was through the create react app. I had never used this before but I know many people used it last year for the Software Engineering Group Project. It was difficult to get started as I had very little experience coding in JavaScript but over time I got more comfortable. I created a home page where the user can search a GitHub username they would like to analyse. Then the data is displayed under various headings and visualized through a pie chart and a line graph. 

### Visualisations:
